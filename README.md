This is a blender animation i created where tetris pieces fall unsatisfyingly into their incorrect places. I initially planned to make them softbodies however there were too many issues. The animation can be viewed [here](https://github.com/M0HID/unsatisfying-tetris/blob/main/output.mp4) and the .STL file can be viewed [here](https://github.com/M0HID/unsatisfying-tetris/blob/main/tetris.stl)
